<h1 align="center">Katsuki</h1>

<p align="center"><i>A traveller's perfect companion!</i></p>

<p align="center">Katsuki is a Discord Bot designed with features I particularly wanted in my discord server. Her design is entirely based on my OC, the mascot of my <a href="https://twitch.tv/GodsonTM">Twitch channel</a>, thus making her a perfect companion to the discord server she resides in.</p>

<p align="center">Although she was designed with features <i>I wanted</i>, her code is 100% public and open source, allowing others to look at, modify, or even host their own version of the bot.</p>

<p align="center">Katsuki comes equipped with ASPNetCore, which is used for allowing other services to retrieve some pieces of data from Katsuki, or to have Katsuki perform basic tasks, such as pulling a quote from the database, or sending a message to a predetermined channel in Discord. <b>Documentation is currently not provided for this web API.</b></p>

<p align="center">Katsuki's documentation is in the form of a decent amount of comments within each class. There is also some xml documentation added to a good number <sub>(if not most)</sub> classes. So if you'd like to go digging around the code to see what makes Katsuki tick, you shouldn't have <i>too much</i> trouble.</p>
